# Cannot use this generally. Interferes with the check via `monit summary`.
# I.e. when things are ready the failure of grep to match aborts us.

# Check for post-start scripts to run. We may not have any.
#
# * `flock` is used to guard against monit starting this script
#   multiple times when our dependency checking and/or the invoked
#   scripts are taking too long.
#
# * `monit summary` is used to check if the __other__ jobs are up.
#   Nothing is done while they are not up yet. We know that we are
#   `post-start`, important to exclude ourselves from the check
#
# Doing our own dependency checking works around issues in monit.
# This can be shifted to monit itself ('depends on') when we reach use
# of monit v5.15+ where the issues are fixed.
